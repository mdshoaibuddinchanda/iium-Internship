torch==2.4.1+cpu
torchvision==0.19.1+cpu

# Additional utilities
matplotlib>=3.7.0  # For plotting and visualization
seaborn>=0.12.0  # Statistical plotting
scikit-learn>=1.3.0  # Machine learning utilities

# Notes:
# - The extra-index line applies to the packages below it (torch/torchvision).
# - If you have a CUDA-capable GPU and want GPU acceleration, remove the
#   extra-index line and install the matching CUDA wheels from pytorch.org.
# - Some packages like PaddleOCR may require additional system dependencies
# - First run may be slower due to model downloads (requires internet connection)
